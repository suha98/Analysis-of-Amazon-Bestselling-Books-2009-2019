# An Analysis of Amazon's Bestselling Books from 2009-2019

Data from Amazon's top 50 bestselling books list from the years 2009 to 2019 was published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019). The original dataset contained the following columns:
- Name - The book's title
- Author - The Author's name
- User Rating - The rating of the book on Amazon
- Reviews - Total number fo reviews left by readers
- Price - The price of the book
- Year - The year it was on the bestseller list
- Genre - The genre of the book (either fiction or non-fiction)

After downloading the data, I manually added the 'Genre' column by looking up the authors.

A range of insights were gained from the data; the notebook and my edited dataset have both been uploaded in the repository.
